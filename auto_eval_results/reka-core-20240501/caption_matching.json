The texture changes from a fresh, moist appearance to a dry, wrinkled state, and the cavity within the apple becomes more pronounced as the decay progresses. These observations align with the natural process of an apple decaying over time, which involves dehydration and the breakdown of its cellular structure.

The video does not provide a direct comparison of the speed of their rotations, but it does show the sun's surface features moving, which implies its rotation. The earth is shown in a way that does not indicate any rotation, which is likely due to the simplification of the model used for the video.
