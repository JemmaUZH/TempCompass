This effect is clearly visible in the video provided, as the particles of the field are suspended in the air for a longer period than they would be in a video shot at standard speed, and the overall motion of the foot and ball is very smooth and extended."

The plant does not appear to be reviving, as one would expect to see some green color return or leaves becoming more rigid if that were the case.

In sports videos, when the frame rate is normal or the speed is not altered, players move fluently without any visual glitches or abrupt changes in their positions between frames. In contrast, slow motion would show a much more gradual movement, and a stopped frame would show players in a fixed position without any motion.

This is evident from the increasing brightness on the horizon and the visible changes in the sky's color, which is shifting from a darker to a lighter blue. The stars are still visible in the sky, but they appear less prominent as the overall brightness of the scene increases.

This is different from playing a video on fast forward, which would not capture the gradual changes in such detail, and it is not in slow motion, which would make the video slower than real-time.

In slow motion, the movement would be much smoother and more deliberate, which is not the case here. Therefore, the best option is:\n\nA. normal speed"
