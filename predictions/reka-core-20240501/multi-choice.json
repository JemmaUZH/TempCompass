There is no indication that the video has been altered to change its speed, and the movements of the people appear to be in real-time. The lighting and the context suggest that it's an evening event, and the atmosphere is energetic and typical of a pool party with friends or at a club. The best option is B. normal speed."

This is observed as the camera starts from a position where the right side of the pool is in view and then moves towards the left side of the pool, capturing the people and the environment as it goes along this horizontal path.

This can be inferred from the video as the background elements on the left side, such as the poolside bar and the vertical pipes or columns, are seen to move from the right side of the frame to the center and then out of the frame on the left side. The movement of people and water splashes also align with this direction, as they appear to be moving from right to left across the frame."

Initially, the camera is focused on a group of people at the edge of the pool and as the video progresses, the camera moves to the left, showing more of the pool area and eventually capturing the presence of other individuals who are inside the pool. There is no indication of zooming in or out, as the size of the subjects relative to the frame does not significantly change."

This is indicated by the consistent motion of the background from right to left across all the frames and the way the people are being revealed as the camera moves. The pool's edge and the people on the right side of the frame come into view as the camera progresses, which would not be the case if the camera were moving in any other direction."
