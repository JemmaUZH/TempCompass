This effect is clearly visible in the video provided, as the particles of the field are suspended in the air for a longer period than they would be in a video shot at standard speed, and the overall motion of the foot and ball is very smooth and extended."

The plant does not appear to be reviving, as one would expect to see some green color return or leaves becoming more rigid if that were the case.

In sports videos, when the frame rate is normal or the speed is not altered, players move fluently without any visual glitches or abrupt changes in their positions between frames. In contrast, slow motion would show a much more gradual movement, and a stopped frame would show players in a fixed position without any motion.
