The video does not provide any direct information about the relative speeds of the trucks. However, based on the consistent positioning of the white truck in the top lane across the frames, it can be inferred that it is maintaining a steady speed relative to the camera's perspective. Without additional visual cues such as motion blur or reference points, it is not possible to accurately determine whether the white truck is driving at the same speed as, faster than, or slower than the truck in the bottom lane. Therefore, none of the provided pieces of information (A, B, or C) can be confirmed as consistent with the video without making assumptions. A neutral caption for the video could be: \"Aerial view of two trucks driving on parallel lanes of a highway during sunrise or sunset.\""
